1.In the previous assignment we found a number of sources describing the conduct of the elevator. We will use the information we gathered from them.
- "The science behind elevators" , describes options for efficient operation of the elevator. https://youtu.be/xOayymoIl8U

- "Elevator system design" , explains how the elevator works. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siqiJAJWUVg&t=1425s&ab_channel=ThinkSoftware

- "How elevator work" , gives ideas for specific reference regarding elevator operation. https://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/elevator7.htm

2. off-line Algorithm:
This algorithm separates the calls for two groups- up and down- and then take number of elevators for the calls up and the rest for down according to the percent. Then dividing the number of calls up in the number of elevators up,same as down.then for every elevators we get average numbers of calls. looping in all the calls take the first call and check which call is on the way - by checking: speed time of the elevator, time for close and open the doors, time for star and stop the elevator. we creat list to number the number of the calls to get avarge calls and for avery call we add to the elevator we add 1 to the list in this elevator and also make this calss true because we already found an elevator for it. that loop in the calls if there is false call we will try to find an elevator for it accordind to the schual of the elevator and the the avarage number of the call. if elevevator has more than the avarage or the time to take this call is taking too much time we will sceep up this elevator.
